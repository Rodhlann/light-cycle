[ ] Build LightCycle logic 
    [x] Track previous location in Player objects so I don't have to transmit separately?
    [x] Collision detection....
        [x] Wall Collision
        [x] Player Collision
    [?] Scoring ? 
    [x] Start timer and reset functionality
    [ ] Waiting for players to join state
    [ ] Win / Lose state 
    [ ] Client side game over animation? 
    [ ] Modal for start / game over?
[ ] Styles?
    [x] Figure out how to display current player obviously
        - Make player color static, randomize enemy colors 
    [x] Tron-ify
    [ ] Player count ? 
[ ] Bugs
    [x] Fix bug where players traveling perpandicular to eachother can cross paths at the same moment without dying
    [x] Fix issue where players are no longer controllable separately ? 
    [x] Fix memory leak on client side when play lasts awhile
        - Register and check collision by line instead of by pixel 
    [ ] Fix issue where sometimes player is not controllable on start ?
        - Happens often when player is moving UP 
    [x] Fix issue where start pixel doesn't appear to be drawn 
        - e.g. [100,400],[400,400] start causes unexpected collision
    [ ] Fix bug where sometimes session doesn't get reset properly 
        - e.g. multiple players but one client running
        - This seems to happen most when debugging frequently
[ ] Improvements
    [x] Calculate rectangles instead of individual grid cells for collision detection and drawing
    [x] Figure out Server / Client framerate 
    [-] Figure out if I can just load game loop logic from server on client connect
